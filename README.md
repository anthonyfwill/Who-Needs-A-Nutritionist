# Who Needs A Nutritionist
This app determines how healthy certain recipes or meals are. The user will enter in the name of a meal/recipe, and it will provide the user with a nutritional analysis of their meal, which they can then save to avoid repetition. In addition, the user is able to log the meal in their day and check off what they have already consumed that day as well.
